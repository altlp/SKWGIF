This code is for our paper: 
Zhonggui Sun, Bo Han, Jie Li, Jin Zhang, Xinbo Gao, 
"Weighted Guided Image Filtering With Steering Kernel."
IEEE Transactions on Image Process, 29 (2020): 500-508. 
Due to the code supports the different types of input image, it is sightly slower
than the one presented in our paper.

Several parts of the code are modified from the following works of other experts:

[1] Kaiming He, Jian Sun, and Xiaoou Tang. "Guided image filtering." 
IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence 35.6 (2012): 1397-1409.

 "Kernel regression for image processing and reconstruction."
